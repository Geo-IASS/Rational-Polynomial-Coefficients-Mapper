# Rational-Polynomial-Coefficients-Mapper
C++ class that uses RPC coefficients to map an object's space coordinates represented in Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude to a sensor position represented in X,Y.

RPCs are used to help us understand where an object is within a plane when taking a picture. For example, the Washington Monument can be found in the image after it has been taken by which pixel you should look at if you want to see the Washington Monument in the image (pixel 506 in the x direction and 364 in the y direction).

The code is well documented both inline and in the documentation files in this repo.
