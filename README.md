# Rational-Polynomial-Coefficients-Mapper
C++ class that uses RPC coefficients to map an object space coordinate represented in Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude to a sensor position represented in X,Y.

RPCs are used to help us understand where an object we are taking a picture of (the Washington Monument for example) can be found in the image (pixel 506 in the x direction and 364 in the y direction for example).

The code is well documented both inline and in the documentation files in this repo.
